// Field-map character jitter: the probe that identified the cause, and the two
// halves of the fix for it. See field_physics.h.
//
// The halves are a rescale of the engine constant behind the jitter, which makes
// it mean a speed instead of a per-frame distance, and a resting stabilizer that
// holds the character still while it is genuinely at rest. The rescale alone
// keeps ground contact but leaves a small sawtooth, because gravity goes on
// integrating while resting; the stabilizer is what removes the motion. Both are
// env-gated and inert by default, so they can be A/B'd against vanilla and
// against each other at runtime.
//
// The probe (DUSK_FIELD_TRACE=1) wraps the controller's per-frame update and,
// on each ground-contact change, dumps the frames either side of it. That is how
// the cause was measured, and it is kept because it is how any future build gets
// re-checked.

//
// A released frame starts from vel.Y = 0, since the previous frame zeroed it,
// so the distance it produces is g*dt^2: about 0.0007 units at 144 Hz. That is
// below the rescaled threshold, and below the game's own, at every frame rate
// above roughly 29 fps. So the resolver reverts the released frame like any

// runs. The hatch cost a frame of holding and bought nothing.
//

// itself. Ground receding downward would need the snap, but no Arland field map
