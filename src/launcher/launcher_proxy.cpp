// 32-bit MSIMG32 proxy for the Dusk front-ends. Ported from the Arland project's

// mechanism.
//
// All six Dusk front-ends are 32-bit and statically import MSIMG32, exactly as
// the Arland ones do, so one DLL is loaded into each and does a different job
// in each:
//
//   Atelier_<Game>Launcher.exe -> start dusk-fix-launcher.exe instead, if it is
//                                 installed, or the game itself when
//                                 dusk-fix.ini asks for that with
//                                 [Launcher] SkipLauncher
//   Atelier_<Game>Env.exe      -> nothing; the settings editor is only forwarded
//                                 to. It writes the game's own Setting.ini, and
//                                 Ayesha reads its resolution straight out of
//                                 that file with no clamping of its own
//                                 so there is nothing here worth patching.
//
// Everything else that loads it just gets the two forwarded GDI entry points.

// ---- the launcher redirect -------------------------------------------------
//
// Steam runs Atelier_<Game>Launcher.exe. When our own launcher is installed
// beside it we run that instead, and the stock one never puts a window on
// screen, so a plain drop-in install replaces it with no extra steps.
//
// [Launcher] SkipLauncher in dusk-fix.ini turns that into a straight start of
// the game: neither front-end appears and the configured settings are used as
// they stand. Only the destination changes -- everything below about when the
// substitution happens and how long this process lives applies unchanged, which
// is what keeps the Steam session, the overlay and Steam Input attached either
// way.
//
// Two things about *when* and *for how long* this happens are load-bearing, and
// both were learned the hard way in the Arland project:
//
//  - It must not happen in DllMain. This DLL is a static import of the
//    launcher, so its process attach runs before the executable's entry point
//    and before anything injected into the process has finished setting itself
//    up -- including Steam's overlay, which hooks process creation in order to
//    follow the game into child processes. Starting our launcher from there
//    produced a child Steam knew nothing about: no overlay, no frame-rate
//    counter, and no Steam Input, which is what makes a DualSense work at all
//    when Steam is handling it. So the redirect is armed here and runs at the
//    executable's entry point instead, by which time the process is fully
//    assembled.
//
//  - The stock launcher process must stay alive while ours is open, rather than
//    being terminated the moment its replacement starts. It is the process
//    Steam launched and is counting, and the game is started from our launcher
//    underneath it. Waiting costs nothing -- this process has no window and no
//    work of its own once its entry point belongs to us.
//
// Nothing here is destructive if the install is partial: with no
// dusk-fix-launcher.exe next to it the redirect is never armed and the stock
// launcher comes up exactly as before. That is the state this repository ships
// in today, so SkipLauncher is the only path that currently does anything.
//
// DUSK_NO_REDIRECT stands the redirect down. Our launcher will set it on the
// original launcher and settings editor when its own buttons open them, which
// is what stops those buttons from being bounced straight back here.

// What the redirect starts: our launcher normally, the game itself when
// SkipLauncher is set. `g_startsGame` only picks the wording in the log.

// Setting.ini keeps whatever the display happened to be when it was last
// resolved, and a display change is never noticed.
//
// The Arland mod closes the same gap in its DLL, which overrides the swap chain
// at device creation. That does not port here: Arland can present at a size the
// game did not choose because it also carries a render-to-display fit pass to
// bridge the two (supersample.cpp). Dusk has no such pass, so a swap chain that
// disagrees with the size the engine picked for its own targets would put the
// scene in a corner of the backbuffer. Writing the game's own field instead is
// both safer and more honest: the game reads it itself, so the resolution is
