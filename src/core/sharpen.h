// Contrast-adaptive sharpening, run over a surface in place.
//
// WHY IT PAIRS WITH SMAA. SMAA is morphological: it finds an edge and blends
// across it, which removes the staircase and softens the edge in the same
// stroke. A sharpening pass afterwards makes it look crisp again without
// bringing the staircase back, because it works on local contrast rather than
// on geometry. Supersampling in this mod already folds a sharpen into its downscale
// for exactly this reason -- a box filter is an average and an average is a
// blur -- so the pre-UI antialiasing path having none was the odd one out.
//
// THE FILTER IS AMD'S CAS, not an unsharp mask. The difference matters at the
// extremes: an unsharp mask sharpens uniformly and rings on already-hard edges,
// while CAS derives its weight from the local minimum and maximum so flat
// regions are left alone and high-contrast edges are sharpened LESS than
// mid-contrast ones. On a 2013 game being magnified that is the behaviour worth
// having: it lifts texture detail without haloing the interface art or the hard
// edges of the world.
//
// RUN AFTER THE ANTIALIASING, never before. Sharpening first would give SMAA
// harder edges to find and it would blend them away again, which is work spent
// to arrive back where it started.

float sharpenAmount();

// Shorthand for sharpenAmount() > 0, for the gates that only ask whether the
// pass is on at all. It is INDEPENDENT of edge smoothing: the two run at the
// same moment and one is not a prerequisite for the other. Sharpening a frame
// that was never antialiased is a legitimate thing to want -- it is what the
// setting means when edge smoothing is off.

// cannot read and write one resource in the same draw -- the runtime unbinds
