// Rate-limits the games' controller rescan while no pad is connected.
//
// THE MECHANISM, which is shared by all six DX ports. Gust's input layer keeps a
// pad pointer in a global; while it is null, the per-frame input update retries
// device acquisition. That retry is already gated -- `cmp eax, 0x3c` limits it
// to once per 60 input-update ticks -- and the games do NOT do the thing this
// defect is usually blamed on: there is no per-frame poll of four XInput slots.
// Each executable imports exactly two XInput entries by ordinal, calls
// XInputGetState from exactly two sites, and the 0..3 loop inside the create
// function is a free-slot search over an internal occupancy bitmask that exits
// at the first clear bit.
//
// WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS is the other half of the rescan. Ayesha and the three
// Arland games run the descriptor twice per attempt, forcing the IDirectInput8*
// field to null on the first pass, so each rescan is one XInputGetState plus one
// IDirectInput8::EnumDevices(GAMECTRL, ATTACHEDONLY). Escha & Logy and Shallie
// make a single attempt and always pass the live interface, so their XInput path
// is dead code and enumeration is their whole cost. Under Proton that
// enumeration goes through Wine's HID/SetupDi device tree, which is the
// suspected expense -- and hooking XInputGetState, the remedy this defect
// usually gets, would therefore do nothing at all for two of the three Dusk
// games and remove only the cheap half in the third.
//
// THE CORRECTION is a wall-clock floor on the *pad* rescan: the hook returns
// null without calling through unless enough real time has passed since the last
// FAILED attempt. A successful attempt is never suppressed and clears the
// backoff, so hot-plug still works -- just at a longer period than 60 ticks.
// Hooking one function down (the caller that enumerates devices) would also
// suppress the KTGL games' keyboard and third-device retries, which is why the
// pad wrapper specifically is the target.
//
// NOT YET MEASURED, and deliberately OptIn because of it. The mechanism is
// mapped in all six executables and matches the reported symptom -- periodic,
// only while no pad is present, gone the instant one is found -- but nobody has
// timed the call. `DUSK_PAD_RESCAN_PROBE=1` reports how long the real wrapper
// takes and how often it runs, which is the measurement that decides whether
// this should ship on at all. A periodic spike of 3 ms or more confirms it;
// consistently under half a millisecond falsifies it and the stutter is
// something else.
