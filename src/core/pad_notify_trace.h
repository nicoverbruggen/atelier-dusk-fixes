// Records whether a controller plugged in under Proton produces a device-arrival
// notification inside the game's process. It is log-only: it hooks nothing,
// suppresses nothing, changes nothing the game does, and stays asleep unless
// DUSK_PAD_NOTIFY_TRACE is set.
//
// THE QUESTION IT EXISTS FOR. pad_rescan.h records what the controller rescan
// costs: while no pad is connected the games call IDirectInput8::EnumDevices
// about three times a second, and on Ayesha that call was measured at 3.5 ms on
// average. The correction shipping today is a three-second wall-clock floor on
// the retry, which trades a wait for the cost rather than removing either. The
// design that removes both is to suppress every retry and let exactly one
// through when a device actually appears, and that design is only possible if
// the arrival can be observed from inside this process.
//
// WHAT IS ALREADY SETTLED is that the mechanism exists in Wine.
// dlls/user32/input.c implements RegisterDeviceNotificationW for real, through
// I_ScRegisterDeviceNotification and with explicit DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFACE
// handling, and programs/plugplay/main.c sends WM_DEVICECHANGE for
// device-interface events. What is NOT settled, and what only a run can answer,
// is whether a game controller arriving through evdev and winebus reaches a
// window in this process as a GUID_DEVINTERFACE_HID arrival.
//
// SO IT REGISTERS TWICE, ON TWO WINDOWS. One notification filters on
// GUID_DEVINTERFACE_HID, which is the answer the next design needs. The other
// asks for every interface class, because "the HID filter never fired" and "no
// device event of any kind reached this process" produce the same empty log and
// call for opposite conclusions. Each registration owns its own window so every
// logged event names which one delivered it; the message itself carries no way
// to tell them apart.
//
// A MESSAGE-ONLY WINDOW DOES NOT RECEIVE BROADCASTS, which is the one way this
// diagnostic could answer no for the wrong reason. Notifications from
// RegisterDeviceNotificationW are sent to the registered window directly and
// arrive either way, but a WM_DEVICECHANGE sent with BroadcastSystemMessageW
// goes to top-level windows only and never reaches HWND_MESSAGE. Setting
// DUSK_PAD_NOTIFY_TRACE=2 builds the same two windows as hidden top-level ones
// instead, so a silent log from the default mode can be told apart from a
// process that hears nothing whichever window it owns.
//
// It runs on a thread of its own with a pump of its own, and it does not go near
// the game's window or its WndProc. A diagnostic asking a question about this
// process's message handling must not be able to break it.
//
// Core owns it for the same reason core owns the pad rescan: the input layer is
// Gust framework code shared by all six DX ports, and this asks nothing about
// either engine.
