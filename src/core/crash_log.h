// Crash logger: a last-chance unhandled-exception filter that appends a
// post-mortem to dusk-fix.log before the process dies -- exception code,
// faulting access, registers, and every stack value that looks like a return
// address, each resolved to module+RVA so a crash inside the game or this mod
// can be mapped straight back to a function. Best-effort by design: it only
// reads memory it has VirtualQuery-verified, guards against re-entry, and
// chains to the previously installed filter (Wine/winedbg backtraces and
// PROTON_LOG output are unaffected because the exception continues its search).
//
// Ported unchanged from the Arland project (this project's own code, MIT).
// Without a crash handler a fault is indistinguishable from the process being
// closed: a supersampling run that died at ~19 seconds left nothing in the log
// but healthy counters, so every diagnostic this mod writes stopped one line
// short of the thing that mattered.
namespace atfix {

// Idempotent;
// DUSK_CRASH_LOG=0 disables it. Installing the process-wide callback pins this
// DLL until process exit so the operating system can never call unmapped code;
// the operation is therefore intentionally irreversible.
